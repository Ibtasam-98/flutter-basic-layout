# flutter_layout_basics

A Flutter project demonstrating fundamental layout widgets.

## About This Repository

This repository, located at [https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/flutter_layout.git](https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/flutter_layout.git), serves as a growing collection of basic Flutter layout examples. Currently, it provides clear and concise demonstrations of the following core layout widgets:

- **Row:** Arranging widgets horizontally.
- **Column:** Arranging widgets vertically.
- **Stack:** Layering widgets on top of each other.

Over time, this repository will be updated with code examples for more Flutter layout widgets (such as `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Align`, `Center`, `Padding`, `GridView`, `ListView`, and more) as new tutorials are created. Check back periodically for updates and expanded coverage of Flutter's UI building blocks!

This resource is intended to provide a foundational understanding of Flutter's layout system and is a great starting point for developers of all levels.
