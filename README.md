# flutter_layout_basics

A Flutter project demonstrating fundamental layout widgets.

## About This Repository

This repository located at https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/flutter_layout.git will serves as a growing collection of basic Flutter layout examples. Currently, it provides demonstrations of the following core layout widgets:

- **Row:** Arranging widgets horizontally.
- **Column:** Arranging widgets vertically.
- **Stack:** Layering widgets on top of each other.
- **Container:** How to use the Container widget for styling and layout.
- **Button:** How to add various types of buttons in Flutter.
- **BottomNavigationBar:** Implementing a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen for easy navigation between different sections.

Over time this repository will be updated with code examples for more Flutter widgets (such as `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Align`, `Center`, `Padding`, `GridView`, `ListView`, and more) as new tutorials are created. Check back periodically for updates and expanded coverage of Flutter's UI building blocks!
